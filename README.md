# Data_Collection
Module 11 Data Collection


## This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
<p> Not many challenges with this portion except for needing to search and update my chrome driver. 
### Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
<p> My original code for the analysis portion when calculating the number of days in a martian year containted:
  
  <code>data_frame.set_index('terrestrial_date', inplace=True)
     
<p> Which caused me to have an error because it removed the field from the dataframe. When I removed it, the code gave me the results I wanted without errors.
